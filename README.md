THings we need to install to run these servers in your machine

for Client side =>
                    npm i
                        axios
                        bootstrap
                        react
                        react-dom
                        react-filter-search
                        react-redux
                        react-scripts
                        react-transition-group
                        reactstrap
                        redux
                        redux-thunk
To run servers 
    
both: npm run dev
front: npm run client
back: npm run server

The client side uses something called REDUX it is a state manager.
What does it do?
It keeps track of the states we have been and
how our data is following it is a little hard
to understand it in code but I like to think 
about this acronomy <- (misspleed) as CARS.

C -> Components
A-> Actions
R-> Reducers
S-> Store

I highly recommend getting the redux tools in your browser
it is very helpful.
