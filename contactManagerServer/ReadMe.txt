To use this file you have to run to intall the required packages--> npm install mongoose jsonwebtoken validator bcryptjs express.

This folder includes the server as well as the database. I connected them together and created a few endpoints for different actions.

In the database there are User and Contact. Each contact has a user owner.

I tested all the endpoints using postman and Mongodb Atlas.

The file you need to run is server.js
